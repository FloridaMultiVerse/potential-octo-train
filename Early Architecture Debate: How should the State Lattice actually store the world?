Kicking off discussion on the storage backbone (post-RFC-0001).

Right now we know we want:
- Immutable cells at fixed 3D coords
- Fast local reads for nodes in their k-hop bubble
- Provable state (Merkle-ish)

But *how* do we index / persist that data efficiently at scale?

Quick poll / brain dump welcome:
- Octree family (sparse voxel octree, loose octree, …)?
- Space-filling curve (Morton/Hilbert) → sorted keys + Merkle tree?
- Chunk/grid + per-chunk Merkle root (à la Minecraft + Ethereum trie)?
- Pure spatial hashmap with coordinate hashing?
- Something else entirely?

Pros/cons, crate recommendations, war stories, or napkin sketches all appreciated.

Once we have rough consensus, we'll formalize as RFC-0002 and start coding a prototype.

Fire away!
